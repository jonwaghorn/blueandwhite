      <p>This is an account of my experiences over thirty years of collecting antique British blue and white china in New Zealand. I have included a <strong>history of the development</strong> of this form of earthenware, with a brief history of each maker represented in the collection. I have put together a <strong>plan for recognition of maker, and dating</strong> of individual pieces.</p>
      <p><strong>The collection</strong> (100 pieces) is shown with stunning photography by Mark Forster-King. The images display the beauty, variety, and history of these objects.</p>

      <p>I have gathered details about many of the <strong>museum collections</strong> in New Zealand, and I emphasize reference opportunities in our country.</p>
      <p>An <strong>extensive bibliography</strong> serves as an introduction to the large volume of written work on the subject, again with an emphasis on New Zealand library resources.</p>
      <p>Access is free, <a href="https://app.box.com/s/6hkh7mtcero02skgavis" target="_blank">download</a> (pdf).</p>
      <p>I am a retired renal physician, living in Hamilton, New Zealand.<br/>
        Mark Forster-King is a clinical photographer at the Waikato Hospital, where he and I met. Mark is a recognized specialist in his field.</p>
